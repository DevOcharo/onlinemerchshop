  <h1>About MERCH.</h1>
  <p>Born in Ongata Rongai, we’re redefining Kenyan streetwear with bold minimalism. 
  Our collections are inspired by everyday hustle, Rongai vibes, and the energy of Nairobi.</p>
  <p>We believe fashion should be simple, affordable, and expressive — made for the streets, made for you.</p>
